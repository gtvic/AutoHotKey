# AutoHotKey
A repository where I will put every single one of the AutoHotKey scripts I have made.



#### The "In The Deep AFK D2.ahk" is a file that makes you able to AFK in the In The Deep mission in Destiny 2. You have to hit Ctrl+J for it to start, and you can stop the program by hitting Ctrl+K. I wouldn't recommand AFKing/Macroing in Destiny as it is now forbidden, so use this file with this in mind.
