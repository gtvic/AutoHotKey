# AutoHotKey
A repository where I will put every single one of the AutoHotKey scripts I have made.



#### The "In The Deep AFK D2.ahk" makes you able to AFK in the In The Deep mission in Destiny 2. You have to hit Ctrl+J for it to start, and you can stop the program by hitting Ctrl+K. I wouldn't recommand AFKing/Macroing in Destiny as it is now forbidden, so use this file with this in mind.


#### The "melon.ahk" makes you able to afk in Hypixel Skyblock. I use it to afk in the Garden, with a 5-0.5 3 floor melon farm. All you have to do is to put your "Attack" key on Spacebar, and hit either Left arrow key (to farm while going on the right) or Right arrow key (to farm while going to the right). If you want to stop farming, just hit Bottom arrow key. If you want to close this file, hit Ctrl+J.
